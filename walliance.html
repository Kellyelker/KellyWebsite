										In my opinion, the working alliance is arguably the most important aspect of counselling.
										Reflecting through this journey the past three years, I believe that regardless of your
										theoretical orientation the best predictor of change and growth is developing a working
										alliance between you and your counsellor. From personal and professional experience
										in counselling, developing a rapport and bond with your counsellor will lead to client
										change and success.

											Working Alliance</b>

										“There is not a doubt in my mind that the working alliance creates positive outcomes in
										therapy. From our first semester in fall to our third semester this spring, we have read
										an abundant amount of articles, journals, and books that argue that the therapeutic
										alliance is one of the strongest predicators of change. Truscott (2010) states that highly
										effective therapists establish a mutual understanding toward goals that are meaningful
										to the client and true collaboration comes from empathically listening to the clinics view
										of their place in the world. Truscott (2010) was the first book I read in this program.
										From this week’s readings we have read similar arguments. Horvath (2006) states that
										there is a strong amount of evidence that the therapeutic relationship is strongly linked
										to positive client change. This essential feature of therapy consistently proves that a
										stronger working alliance creates improved therapeutic outcomes. Safran and Muran
										(2006) argued that that concept of the therapeutic alliance “highlights the fact that at a
										fundamental level the patient’s ability to trust, hope and have faith in the therapists
										ability to help always plays a central role in the change process” (pp. 289). From my
										own personal experience in therapy I definitely agree that feeling the alliance, support,
										and trust between you and the therapist creates a positive experience which most likely
										will lead to positive change.”

										“One important counsellor variable and teacher as well (since I am both of these roles
										right now) that is important to the success of the working alliance is warmth. Young
										(2017) argues that warmth has a powerful effect on the client’s willingness to open
										Furthermore, Nissen-Lie, Monsen, &amp; Ronnestad (2010) state that counsellors who are
										perceived as warm, accepting, and empathic establish a successful working alliance.
										Alliance ratings are considerably more positive when clients perceive their counsellor
										exhibiting these warm traits and feel as though the counsellor understands their
										emotional expressions and feelings (Nissen-Lie, et al., 2010). I definitely agree with
										these arguments as I have been teaching for 4 years now and taking a job as a mental
										health teacher combined the role of a counsellor/teacher. When students know that you
										sincerely care about them, want to understand how they are feeling, accept them, and
										are empathic to their situations the working alliance will continue to be strong and
										successful. Young (2017) demonstrates how nonverbal messages can communicate
										warmth, such as tone of voice, gestures, facial expression and eye contact. All of these
										traits are so important to facilitate because when students or clients recognize warmth
										they respond by opening up which builds trust in the relationship.”

										“Combining Keeney’s (1990) model with the working alliance structuring skills from
										Hiebert (2005) can be very useful to a counsellor as both models discuss the
										importance of meaningful focus on each counselling session. For example, Keeney
										(1990) discusses the importance of the overall flow of the counselling process, as each
										session (beginning, middle, and end) progresses through frames of meaning. This is
										very similar to Hiebert (2005) as he argued that when clients know what to expect and
										can identify where they are in the process of counselling, it will help create a more
										meaningful interaction between the counsellor and client. Being able to map out and
										understand the natural flow of the sessions will allow the counsellor to reflect and
										
										assess on whether the use of these skills develop and maintain the working alliance
										from the beginning to end.”
