									<p>During our Group Counselling Course, I developed a manual for group therapy for
										adolescents struggling with anxiety. As one of my special interests is working with
										adolescents, I developed a manual using mindfulness and CBT to help reduce
										adolescent stress and anxiety using a variety of techniques. During my time running a
										mental health program at St. Mary’s High School, I took part in many group therapy
										sessions with our students that was led by the program psychologist.

									<p>
										<b>The proposal below provided the rationale for creating the group: Group Therapy
										for Adolescents Struggling with Anxiety.</b>												
									</p>
									<p>
										“Anxiety disorders are the most commonly diagnosed psychological disorders and
										mental health concern occurring in 5% to 19% of all adolescents (James, James,
										Cowdrey, Soler, &amp; Choke, 2018). Berk (2011) states that adolescence is the time period
										marked by a great deal of transitions from the ages of 13 to 18 years of old. La Greca
										and Ranta (2015) argue that the transition periods of adolescence include an increase
										of new social and emotional functioning, however, the novelty brings uncertainty, failure,
										and distress. High school students, aged 14 to 18, are faced with many concerns and
										questions regarding their future after high school. Many adolescent students suffer from
										Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), which is characterized in the Diagnostic and
										Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR), as excessive worry or anxiety, restlessness, irritability,
										sleep problems, and difficulty concentrating (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).
										Furthermore, adolescents that are diagnosed with GAD suffer from chronic, excessive
										worry in areas such as homework, tests, and assignments, social interactions, difficulty
										controlling worries, and perfectionistic seeking (Connolly, Suarez, &amp; Sylvester, 2011).
										Adolescents with an anxiety disorders are more likely to also suffer from depression,
										eating disorders, attention deficit disorders (Kumara &amp; Kumar, 2016). If adolescents are
										left untreated, they may face numerous risks such as, poorer academic results,
										avoidance of social activities, and substance abuse problems (Kumara &amp; Kumar, 2016).

										I explored the process of debriefing in counselling. Throughout my time working as a
										teacher and counsellor, I have found the process of debriefing a necessary and critical
										element to grounding myself and being able to leave my day behind me when I go
										home.									</p>
									<p>
										“A sparkling moment was reading about debriefing as a crucial element in group therapy
										in chapter 11. Kottler &amp; Englar-Carlson (2015) argued that regular debriefing should be
										scheduled after every group session. The benefit of debriefing right after a session is
										that the coleaders can critique each other’s performances, giving each other
										constructive feedback and can also discuss and analyze the group dynamics and
										possible goals for each member (Kottler-Carlson, 2015). I co-ran a mental health
										program with another teacher, two educational assistants, a social worker, and a
										psychologist and everyday after school we would meet for at least 15 minutes to go
										over the day and discuss the students. I found that after an emotional day, I needed to
										debrief before I went home. On days were perhaps we didn’t debrief I would go home
										and sometimes cry and watch television – definitely not a good idea. I also found that
										coaching after school or working out helped me end that part of the day and start a new
										part. Overall, debriefing is a critical component in many fields including education,
										health care, and those who are first responders (Sawyer, Eppich, Brett-Fleegler, Grant,
										&amp; Cheng, 2016). Sawyer et al., (2016) list a number of methods on how to debrief which
										I found very interesting to read since there are so many ways we can use debriefing as
										a tool in group therapy.”
