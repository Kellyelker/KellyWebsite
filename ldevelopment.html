										This course examined how the principles of learning relate to behaviour and children
										and adults and how individuals from diverse backgrounds learn to achieve and develop.
										This course also examined the question: How do people learn?
									</p>
					
									<p>
										“How do people learn?” This question has been a debate between theorists for
										thousands of years. (Hammond, Austin, Orcutt, &amp; Rosso, 2011). People have always
										been interested in learning. Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle were some of the
										first theories to enter in this debate. Plato, the rationalist, believed that knowledge is
										innate and within us and Aristotle, the empiricist, believed knowledge is found outside
										ourselves and through the world around us (Hammond et al., 2011). These early
										debates led the path for many other theorists to debate how people learn, such as
										Edward Thorndike who began the systematic study of learning in the 1890’s (Petri &amp;
										Mishkin, 1994). There are many different ways people can learn and today the learning
										debate is ongoing (Hammond et al., 2011).”						
									</p>
									<p>
										-Excerpt from the introduction in Reflection Paper, EDPS 646
									</p>
									<p>
										Learning theories studied in this course were behaviourism, cognitivism and cognitive
										learning, social cognitive theory, experiential learning theory, and bioecological models
										of learning. I really enjoyed learning the bioecological model as it serves as a model that
										takes in a holistic approach to learning as it encompasses connections from all systems.
										During my practicum, working alongside social workers, I developed a more mindful
										approach that encompasses working towards systemic worldviews, as Bronfenbrenner
										suggested looking at all systems.
									</p>
									<p>
										“The bioecological model developed by Urie Bronfenbrenner serves as an integrated
										framework for understanding the connections between an individual, including their
										biological, socio-emotional, and cognitive characteristics along with the diverse social
										and cultural contexts in which an individual progresses (Zhou and Brown, 2015). This
										model examines how an individual’s surrounding environment influences their life. The
										bioecological model is beneficial to educators and counsellors as it examines how an
										individual is influenced by multiple external factors. The strengths of this model serve as
										a guide to help us understand how an individual develops and learns through a complex
										system. The bioecological can be readily applied to readily world problems as well.
										Bronfenbrenner&#39;s’ systems approach allows practitioners, researchers and community
										activists to develop interventions that carter to the different bioecological systems the
										individual interacts with. However, the bioecological model has undergone criticism as
										academic research continues to find issues and complexities within the model as
										Bronfenbrenner was continually re-assessing, revising as well as regretting and
										renouncing his earlier work (Tudge, Mokrova, Hatfield, &amp; Karnik, 2009). Future research
										would be beneficial as confusion lies upon which version of the theory should be
										applied.”
									</p>
									<p>
										My second sparkling moment reading the McCabe (2007) and Poonwassie &amp; Charter
										(2001) articles where they discussed how crucial it is to understand traditional
										worldviews and versus those of the general Canadian population. McCabe (2007)
										argues that improper psychological interventions that are not congruent with Indigenous
										populations can cause another form of colonization. Furthermore, Poonwassie &amp;
										Charter (2001) techniques for facilitating empowerment to Aboriginal clients is an
										important step towards de-colonization. Understanding our client’s worldviews and
										gaining an understanding of ours is crucial in the healing and therapeutic process.
										Conflicting worldviews and ideals in the counselling process can lead to imbalance,
										negativity, and a disconnect between the counsellor and client.”

										<b>Lifespan Human Development 648</b>
									</p>
									<p>
										This course examines developmental themes and theories and what makes us who we
										are across our lifespan as children, adolescents, and adults.					
									</p>
									<p>
										One of the most challenging, yet intriguing assignments in this program was our
										Controversial Issues in Human Development Paper in EDPS 648. My partner and I
										choose to discuss Nature versus Nurture in Depression. This was one of the most
										challenging papers due to the heaviness of biology behind it. Researching the genetic
										findings through which depression is detected was very time consuming and again
										challenging but very rewarding to come out with an amazing breadth of knowledge
										surrounding the genetic factors that cause depression (5-HTTLPR Gene, Brain-Derived
										Neurotrophic Factor Val 66-Met Polymorphism (BDNF) and Hypothalamus-Pituitary-
										Adrenal (HPA) Axis Dysregulation) and environmental factors (childhood maltreatment,
										chronic stress, abuse, and neglect).

									<p>
										Discussion Board Posts, EDPS 648		
									</p>
									<p>
										This discussion board post from week 8 below, displays an example of adolescent
										depression most likely exacerbated by the child’s parents (environment factors).
									</p>
									<p>
										“As many of us have mentioned, I think that a person-centered therapeutic approach
										focusing on Rogers core values of unconditional positive regard, congruence, and
										empathic understanding (Raskin, Rogers, &amp; Witty, 2014). I think the critical factor that
										Dean needs is the therapist listening without prejudice and without a private agenda
										knowing that Dean can share in whatever way he is comfortable.									
									</p>
									<p>
										Dean appears to be spiraling and unable to regulate his emotions and almost taking the
										passenger sit to life in regards to his career and confusing feelings of his sexuality. I
										think that in counselling we should explore his alienation from his mother as this could
										be a contributing factor to his low self-esteem and confidence. Sher (2017) argued that
										adolescents that are alienated from one parent are more likely to suffer from
										depression, guilt, low self-confidence, and alcohol abuse. Sher (2017) states that
										training courses on parental alienation are becoming more popular for mental health
										professionals as the repercussions of alienation and neglect can be severe and
										detrimental to children’s / adolescent’s health. I am curious to see what some of these
										training courses would look like. I liked Julia&#39;s idea of Empty Chair Technique and
										Huma&#39;s idea of the &quot;talk meter&quot; to use with Dean in his sessions.”
