										Starting this program and only having experience with counselling with adolescents in
										the school system, I led my therapeutic approach mainly by Motivational Interviewing
										(MI) , Positive Psychotherapy, Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Solution
										Focused Therapy (SFT), as these approaches have certain benefits in the school
										system, such as being able to provide homework, time efficient, more surface level,
										affordable, short-term, focuses on strengths and positive attributes and slightly faster to
										move through. One of the most popular interventions in the educational system is SFT
										because problems do not need to be discussed in full detail to find the solution, saving
										time as school counsellors might only be able to meet a student for 20 minutes if their
										schedules are full. One of the most useful techniques in SFT are the scaling questions.
										Scaling is used to quantify feelings, clarify next steps, and see progress in the client. I
										think scaling is beneficial because you can ask students if they have always had this
										problem and where was it on the scale before and what did you do to make the situation
										better. This strength-based approach allows students to tap into their own resources to
										solve problems. Last summer my partner and I gave a presentation on SFT and acted
										out the process of SFT using the miracle question, scaling, and exception questions.

										<b>My evolving therapeutic lens</b>	
									</p>
									<p>
										Looking back through discussion posts I have enjoyed looking through and seeing how
										my worldview and therapeutic approached as changed. I felt pressure at the beginning
										of the problem to pick a worldview I would adapt to, so I always stuck with Empiricism.
										However, I always believed that the therapeutic alliance was one of the most important
										aspects of therapy that leads to client change. As time progressed through the program
										and throughout practicum, I developed an integrative approach. I believe that therapists
										need a variety of tools in their toolbelt. For example, working as a school counsellor,
										you definitely need to have a working alliance with the student or else they will never
										come back to see you. The school that I am working at this year, the counsellor here
										comes from a more collectivism approach, as we work at a low SES school, and the
										counsellor is well aware of systemic issues that students and families are facing. During
										my practicum placement, my supervisor led from rationalism as she was trained through										
										a psychoanalytic lens through Transactional Analysis (TA). Through supervision and
										consultation during practicum, I learned more about TA and started to employ this
										approach as one of my main interventions with clients. I found that CBT was too surface
										level and the clients I saw needed a deeper, more in-depth approach to counselling,
										specifically discussing childhood and parental issues. One of the use useful tools in TA
										is script analysis. This is used to gain an insight into the client’s beliefs they have about
										themselves and the world. Clients life script is developed in childhood and reinforced by
										parents and significant others around us that led to thoughts and actions in how we live
										our lives and the way we think of ourselves.

										“Throughout this program I have mainly resonated with CBT as I work with
										adolescents suffering from anxiety and depression and I believe that CBT treatments
										such as correcting and identifying faulty cognitions and correcting thinking errors has
										worked with my students. CBT is one of the most studied psychological treatments for
										anxiety disorders in adolescents (Arendt, Thastum, &amp; Hougaard, 2015). Furthermore, it
										has generated more empirical research and treatments for anxiety than any other
										psychotherapy model (Corey, 2011). However, working with a new teaching staff this
										year in a mental health program that uses mainly positive psychotherapy, solution
										based therapies, and mindfulness I have become confused about my theoretical
										orientation. I believe a collaborative person-centered is the best approach, regardless of
										theoretical orientation and implanting Rogers’s core conditions of change, empathic
										understanding, unconditional positive regard, and congruence are necessary (Raskin,
										Rogers, &amp; Witty, 2014).
									</p>
									<p>
										Currently, at work we offer mediation and mindfulness activities everyday for 30 minutes
										after lunch. Also I work alongside our social worker in his counseling sections where he
										implements a solution based therapeutic approach. He uses techniques such as the
										staircase approach, scaling, and the miracle question to encourage students to find and
										apply strategies to lessen their anxiety.
									</p>
									<p>
										What draws me to eclecticism is the ability to remain flexible in my approach to help
										clients and have a toolbox of strategies and techniques in order to be able to help. A
										limitation in this approach is that it does not provide a framework of practice and I am
										more likely to lose my way in therapy, especially as a new practitioner (Truscott, 2010).”

										“My approach to counseling is a client-centered, holistic, integrative approach it
										allows therapists to select the most meaningful and appropriate approach that can
										address the particular problem the client is presenting (Truscott, 2010).  I believe a
										balance of approaches, such as Transactional Analysis, narrative, EFT and ACT all
										have a place in therapy. Not one client will present with the same issue and have the
										same background so a variety of tools in my tool belt will assist the therapeutic
										process. In addition, Learning Rogers (1957) core conditions of therapeutic change
										always stuck with me. Congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathic
										understanding have been three things that I bring into a counseling session with a
										client.”

										My reflective statement has changed since week 2 but has been constantly reinforced
										throughout this last semester of practicum and perhaps has led to be tilt towards
										psychodynamic theories. I believe that when clients participate in self-reflection and
										develop insight into their own lives and experiences, they are able to achieve greater
										self-understanding leading to change. I think that counsellors benefit from being well
										versed in different areas of interventions as no one client is the same. Finally, first									
										and foremost, I believe the working alliance is one of the key factors that leads to
										successful client outcomes.

										My supervisor is guided by working through a type psychoanalytic theory –
										Transactional Analysis and person-centered therapy. My supervisor believes that as our
										understandings of ourselves change we are better able to make decisions and come up
										with solutions to our problems. The past influences our present day and the patterns of
										all subjective thoughts, feelings, and emotional processes influence our decisions. My
										supervisor runs Insight Counselling and Therapy Centre. The mission is to provide
										counselling services to all, regardless of income and to promote positive change. The
										second location I worked through was The Southwest Community Resource Centre.
										Here they help to provide clients with resources they need, build skills, and increase
										personal resilience by promoting positive change and provide services that strengthen
										the community.

										My counselling journey has been strengthened by belief that through engaging in
										counselling, we can change, grow, and learn to connect with ourselves and others and
										through the process of digging deep into our most inner thoughts and beliefs that guide
										us through our lives. These two photos shown below are two powerful pictures depicting
										my view of counselling.
