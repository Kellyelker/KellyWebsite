									<p><b>Research Methodology in Counselling</b></p>
									<p>This course allowed for the exploration of the methods and processes for designing and
										conducting research in practical settings. One of the main take-aways from this course
										was understanding different purposes and assumptions of the qualitative and
										quantitative paradigms of research. Our group designed a quantitative study to test
										whether a mindfulness-based intervention for adolescents would increase resilience and
										decrease emotional distress.
										</p>

										Intervention, EDPS 610.

									<p>
										During my practicum, I implemented mindfulness-based cognitive behavioural therapy
										interventions on a number of clients. I enjoyed combining two interventions I have used
										on students in the past and have enjoyed continuing my learning on combining these
										two interventions. Below is an excerpt from my Final Case Conceptualization, EDPS
										644 where I describe MCBT.									</p>
									<p>
										“Implementing the combination of mindfulness and cognitive behavioural therapy aims
										to teach individuals to identify and gain control over maladaptive cognitive processes
										with the goal of rewiring brain patterns with positive and realistic ones (Cayoun, Francis
										&amp; Shires, 2019). Mindfulness in conjunction with CBT has been shown to be effective in
										treating depression (Segal, Williams, &amp; Teasdale, 2002) and anxiety disorders (Roemer
										&amp; Orsillo, 2002). Mindfulness-based cognitive behavioural therapy was initially
										developed for individuals suffering from depression as a relapse prevention treatment
										and now has been adapted to treat individuals with a range of mental health conditions
										(Alsubaie, et al., 2017). Alsubaie et al. (2017) argue that MCBT decreases a variety of
										
										health and mental health concerns, such as anxiety, depression, coronary heart
										disease, and diabetes.”
									</p>
									<p><b>Assessment Theories and Practices</b></p>
									<p>
										This course provided the opportunity to enhance the role of assessment, screening, and
										progress monitoring. Listed below, from the EDPS 616 course outline, are counselling
										related concerns in the field of assessment that counsellors must learn to become
										competent in.									
									</p>
									<p>
										“1. Professional assessment must always be client-centered, intended to better
										understand the person, including strengths and needs, in the context of their socio-
										cultural environment and life experiences.									
									</p>
									<p>
										2. Responsible assessment uses empirically-based, professionally sound, clinically
										relevant instruments and methods and a decision-making process that carefully
										considers and integrates information before drawing any conclusions.									
									</p>
									<p>
										3. Ethical assessment considers internal and external factors that influence the
										individual seeking counselling services (e.g., age, gender, health, disability, language,
										race, culture, family, and religion) –as well as the potential risks of assessment
										processes and instruments –and adheres to current professional practice standards and
										ethics.									
									</p>
									<p>
										4. Effective assessment helps to inform intervention, and continues during the
										counselling process in order to evaluate therapeutic response and effectiveness.”									</p>
									<p>
										Studying and learning implementing different types of assessments in our summer
										institute was the most beneficial. We learned how to conduct different assessments on
										anxiety, depression, PTSD, eating disorders, parenting, career transitions, relationships
										and personality assessments. My partner and I conducted our research on the Beck
										Anxiety Inventory (BAI). My partner and I are both teachers and have an interest in
										studying anxiety as it is one of the most common mental health concerns in schools.									</p>

										Below are discussion board excerpts from EDPS 616 that showcase diversity, culture
										and family in assessment									</p>
									<p>
										Week 3 Question 1:									</p>
									<p>
										“No one client will ever be the same. That is the beauty of diversity. Clients will come
										from intersecting identities that make up the uniqueness of who they are. Balkin et al.,
										(2014) urged counsellors not to generalize clients and clump them into categories
										
										based on their various intersections as this will limit and misinterpret the assessment
										process. To appreciate and capture clients’ diversities I will assess and counsel
										clients that is consistent to their cultural values and beliefs, and attempt to
										understand their worldviews and assumptions (Sue &amp; Sue, 2016). Urbina (2014)
										argued that even assessments that have been cautiously constructed still are
										vulnerable and prone to misconstruction which is why counsellors must be aware of
										their biases and judgements in the assessment process and sway clients in the
										process.									</p>
									<p>
										I think by using a collaborative, client-centered approach that this would result in
										client’s sharing their diversity and more positive outcome for client’s in the
										assessment process. Acevedo-Polakovich et al, (2007) outlined four ways that
										assessments are conducted in a culturally sensitive and specific way, such as
										counsellors receiving formal and assessment training, maintaining this training
										throughout their practice, and knowing the client’s history and encompasses them,
										individually, and through their communities. My hope is that I make my client’s
										comfortable enough to share their stories and that I am sensitive to all matters of
										diversity without accidently offending anyone or making assumptions based on my
										own views.”

										Week 3 Question 2:					
									</p>
									<p>
										“Taking a holistic approach into the consideration of cultural contexts such as
										socioeconomic status, race, and ethnicity can help reduce harmful and neglectful
										aspects of assessment practices (Hays, 2017). I really enjoyed reading through the
										tip sheet on multicultural assessment on pages 94 and 95 in the Hays (2017) text.
										One point discussed argued that exploring your own bias and assumptions about
										cultural groups are necessary as we need to reflect on how assumptions you hold
										influence how you assess clients. Sue and Sue (2016) state that culturally competent
										counsellors attempt to understand their own worldviews, biases, and values, as well
										as their client’s worldviews and history of oppression that they may have faced. In
										addition, Hays (2017) states that collaborating with clients, other professionals,
										consulting test manuals and other assessment materials, and keeping up to date with
										research and ethical practices are necessary to reduce neglectful aspects of
										assessment practices. In accordance with the Canadian Code of Ethics for
										Psychologists, it states that engaging in regular monitoring, assessment,
										collaboration and reporting promotes the development of knowledge, care and
										responsibility to society and individuals (CPA, 2017). The concept of contextual
										assessment is critical as it is necessary to look at all the contexts and intersections in
										a client’s life, including, individually and throughout their community. The more we
										understand client’s worldviews and explore biases and assumptions about cultural
										groups in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, ect. assessment practices will become less
										harmful and neglectful.”
