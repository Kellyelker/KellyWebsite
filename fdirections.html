										<p>Graduating from the Masters of Counselling Program I can see myself moving towards
											a few different directions. Since my experience has always been geared towards working
											in education, I always assumed I would stay in education and become a school
											counsellor. Running two different mental health programs within Calgary Catholic have
											afforded me to the opportunity to interact with a wide variety of student populations. I
											love working with adolescents in the classroom, developing relationships with them, and
											coaching a variety of sports as well. I can see myself working in a school at least for
											another few years as I continue to develop my skills.
											</p>
										<p>
											After my counselling practicum at Insight Counselling and Therapy centre, working in
											private practice and at a community centre has opened my eyes to counselling and
											working with adults. I enjoyed working with clients of all ages, ethnicities, religions, and
											backgrounds. I was able to employ a variety of therapeutic interventions as my
											supervisor was open with me experimenting with different techniques and methods,
											such as CBT, ACT, TA, and SFT.
										</p>
										<p>
											My goal right now is to continue to enroll in professional development courses to gain
											experience in learning more about specific counselling interventions, such as DBT and
											couples counselling. In the distant future, I would like to write the EPPP and become
											provincial psychologist work as I work towards becoming a registered psychologist.
