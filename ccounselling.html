									<p>One of my main take-aways from Career Counselling, EDPS 630 was studying different
										theories of career development and their application to counselling. Researching
										theoretical concepts, such as Hollands Theory of Personality, Super’s Developmental
										Theory, Social Cognitive Career Theory, and Systems Theory Framework. I worked in a
										group project studying Systems Theory Framework (STF). System Theory Framework
										combines and recognizes the contribution of all theories and the interconnectedness of
										personal and career influences from a holistic approach. Below is a photo that describes
										the holistic, interconnectedness approach that STF works from.

									<p>While studying career counselling, I was able to examine why I choose a career in
										counselling and how meaningful counselling work as been to me. I believe it is
										
										important to feel a sense of meaning and purpose in your work which is why I choose a
										career in helping others. Below are excerpts from discussion board postings in EDPS
										630 that showcase my passion for counselling and choosing a career that coincides
										with your values, and interests.

									<p>Week 2</p>
									<p>
										“In regards to career counselling, I found positive emotions and flow to be the most
										useful application with career counselling. When reading all the applications, I felt
										drawn to positive emotions and flow as these are said to be central to feeling happy
										and studies argue that individuals who experience more positive emotions in their
										work relate more positive emotions into their personal lives and fill more fulfilled in
										general (Fredrickson, 2013). When I am counselling in school, I am filled with positive
										emotions which relates to job satisfaction as counselling fits my ideal career interests
										and skills. Dik et al. (2015) states employees who feel positive emptions and flow are
										highly engaged and feel a sense of purpose at work. I definitely feel a heightened
										satisfaction and performance when I am feeling more positive and during a high flow
										state.”

									<p>Week 3</p>
									<p>
										The results of my Life Values Inventory identified my core values as concern for others,
										belonging, and responsibility. I am not surprised by these especially concern for others
										and belonging. I find that I have always been concerned for others, which is why I went
										into teaching and counselling because I care for the welfare and well-being of people. I
										am also a very social person and crave a sense of belonging, which is why I love
										teaching and schools because I am social all day and can help students feel like that
										belong, whether that be in the classroom, or a club, I want students to feel comfortable
										to succeed and feel that they belong. I believe that these main values have contributed
										to educational direction as I want to be responsible for the welfare of others and be
										someone that people can depend on.
									</p>
									<p>Week 5</p>
									<p>
										“Do whatever makes you happy” My parents always encouraged to pick a career that
										would make me feel fulfilled. My dad said he become a firefighter because he wanted
										to help people and it made him happy and whatever makes me happy is what I
										should do. In high school I chose electives like psychology and travel and tourism
										because I was interested in these subjects and thought that I could teach them well if
										I became a teacher. My career aspirations can be explained by both motivation and
										achievement levels (Sinclair and Carlsson, 2013). In University I was most interested
										in psychology and sociology so that is that I pursued. I never felt as though my
										options were narrowed by gender or culturally specific boundaries as my parents’
										gender and cultural attitudes were always open and encouraging regardless of sex or
										prestige (Swanson and Fouad, 2015).
