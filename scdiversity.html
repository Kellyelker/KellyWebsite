									<p>“To become a culturally competent in my future practice as a counsellor I will first
										become aware of my own worldviews, biases, and values. I will also attempt to
										understand my client’s needs and worldviews and comprehend the history of
										oppression that have they have experienced as a marginalized group (Sue &amp; Sue,
										2016). Since every client will have a different worldview, I will counsel them in a process
										that defines their goals consistent to their life experiences and cultural values (Sue &amp;
										Sue, 2016). I will employ culture-specific intervention strategies and skills that aligns
										with the client’s beliefs and goals and remain sensitive and non-judgemental in all
										counselling sessions.”

										Taken from Positionality and Intersection Paper, EDPS 624									
									</p>
									<p>
										Throughout this program and practicum, I have learned to be mindful of the diverse
										approaches to healing and employ those that align with my clients needs. I have found
										that a holistic approach to understanding the whole picture of a client’s problems has
										assisted in the healing process. I am striving to become a competent counsellor and be
										aware of the differences of my client’s views. I believe I have been able to hold different
										worldviews than my clients and still be able to resolve challenges in a trustworthy and
										non-judgemental manor. My practicum placement was at Insight Counselling and
										Therapy Centre, here I worked at a community centre, alongside social workers. I saw
										low income clients, from all ages, cultures, religions, and backgrounds. I feel very
										fortunate that I was able to expand my knowledge and gain experience in a diverse and
										multicultural setting. Looking back on our discussion board posts for EDPS 624, I was
										drawn to week 8, as it reflects my perspective on a holistic perspective, drawing
										connections into implementing different therapeutic interventions as no one client is the
										same and there are many ways to help different clients.
									</p>
									<p>
										Below are my week 8 discussion board posts.
									</p>
									<p>
										“My first sparkling moment came from reading promoting Indigenous health mental
										issues by Stewart (2008). I thought that the model of Indigenous mental health and
										healing was a great model to display and show the aspects of healing that counsellors
										need to consider. I especially enjoyed reading the section on the holistic approaches.
										
										Participants in this study argued that a holistic approach was fundamental to the
										practice of healing (Stewart, 2008). Participants said that in a counselling session they
										would like to discuss food, sleeping, exercising, spirituality, prayer, including elders and
										traditional healers in their session, and incorporating nature and the community
										(Stewart, 2008). I definitely agree to this as I find that including a holistic approach to
										counselling allows for these missing pieces to be incorporated into the healing process.
									</p>
									<p>
										My second sparkling moment reading the McCabe (2007) and Poonwassie &amp; Charter
										(2001) articles where they discussed how crucial it is to understand traditional
										worldviews and versus those of the general Canadian population. McCabe (2007)
										argues that improper psychological interventions that are not congruent with Indigenous
										populations can cause another form of colonization. Furthermore, Poonwassie &amp;
										Charter (2001) techniques for facilitating empowerment to Aboriginal clients is an
										important step towards de-colonization. Understanding our client’s worldviews and
										gaining an understanding of ours is crucial in the healing and therapeutic process.
										Conflicting worldviews and ideals in the counselling process can lead to imbalance,
										negativity, and a disconnect between the counsellor and client.”

										<b>Psychological Approaches to Health</b>					
									</p>
									<p>
										This course examined different theories and models of health, illness, and health
										promotion in a variety of settings. Throughout this course, we reviewed a range of
										interventions used in the field of health psychology and holistic wellness. As I am an
										advocate of different interventions and modalities to treat different ailments, such as
										naturopathic medicine, acupuncture, healing circles, charka healing, and tradition
										western medicine, this course offered considerations of how holistic approaches are
										inter connected with each other at an individual, community and health care level.				
									</p>
									<p>
										Below demonstrates my views on different health approaches from our discussion
										board for EDPS, 664.	
									</p>
									<p>
										I think an awareness of the cultural influences on health and illness that impact an
										individual’s life is crucial to becoming a culturally competent counsellor. Since every
										client has a different view on health and illness, it will be critical to counsel them in a
										collaborative process that is consistent to their goals, values, and beliefs (Sue &amp; Sue,
										2016). I believe it is important to recognize that their limitations to the ‘Universal’
										biomedical approach. MacLachlan (2015) argues that an awareness of the process of
										healing used to used to facilitate better heath, such as counsellors showing a greater
										willingness to discuss emotional and spiritual perspectives on health in a holistic
										manor. Clients are more likely to feel valued if counsellors not only understand the
										problem but the person as well and what they need. (MacLachlan, 2015). Sue &amp; Sue
										(2016) made a similar argument in that Western medicine needs to embrace
										alternative methods such as therapeutic touch and charka healing. Culture-specific
										interventions that align with the client’s beliefs will more likely create successful and
										healing interactions with clients. Overall, I think that attempting to understand my
										client’s worldviews on health and illness and knowing my own as well is the first step
										in the counselling process.

										Finally, one of my favourite assignments attached below is an assignment on different
										approaches to stress, anxiety, and depression. This assignment showcased information
										on the variety of approaches such as mindfulness-based interventions, meditation,
										yoga, indigenous approaches, CBT, ACT, narrative therapy, and positive
										psychotherapy. This assignment demonstrates that a holistic approach to wellness and
										health is beneficial as clients react differently to different interventions.
