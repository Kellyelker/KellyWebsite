										<p>My personal approach to counselling has been constantly developing since the start of the Master of Counselling program. In one of the first courses, EDPS 602, we began to orient ourselves in our personal counselling orientation. I had the opportunity to observe counselling sessions in school while I was a mental health teacher. The school psychologist and counsellors practiced a variety of interventions that I was able to observe. One of the common approaches in dealing with adolescent anxiety and depression was implementing Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Through reviewing the different approaches, I landed on CBT as it examines how the influence of behaviours are tied to an individual’s thoughts. Here, the theory of CBT, suggests that therapy will help clients shift from unhealthy cognitions to adaptive, realistic ones. 
											As time passed through our program and learning throughout my practicum, I shifted to develop an integrative approach as I learned more about psychodynamic approaches, as my practicum supervisor specialized in Transactional Analysis (TA) and my supervisor at the SW Community Resource Centre adopted a Systemic Approach. I realized that one approach does not fit all as each client is unique. I believe the development of insight and gaining connections into our mental, physical, spiritual, and thought processes require a client-centered, integrative, holistic approach.

									<p>My approach to counseling is a client-centered, holistic, integrative approach it allows therapists to select the most meaningful and appropriate approach that can address the particular problem the client is presenting (Truscott, 2010).  I believe a balance of approaches, such as Transactional Analysis, narrative, EFT and ACT all have a place in therapy. Not one client will present with the same issue and have the same background so a variety of tools in my tool belt will assist the therapeutic process. In addition, Learning Rogers (1957) core conditions of therapeutic change always stuck with me. Congruence, unconditional positive regard, and empathic understanding have been three things that I bring into a counseling session with a client.
										Previously most of my papers, especially in the first year of school, were all based around a CBT approach, however, after working in practicum and seeing clients, I believe that CBT can sometimes be a little too much on the surface level, and it is important to dig deeper into clients past experiences as a child and with family members. I do believe CBT is useful but depends on the client and the issue they are facing.
